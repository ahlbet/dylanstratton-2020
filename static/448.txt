I believe we are all a handful of shards of memories and moments tossed into a bowl and carelessly shook. And we must embrace our brokenness. I used to long for unity. I used to dream about those shards melting together into something beautiful. I know now I was foolish.  The universe is indifferent towards us. I know now I will always be foolish. I am incessantly drifting in and out of consciousness. I only wish I did not take her with me. For she rebelled against this universe and was not indifferent towards me. She showed me my bare soul, my uninhibited soul. And I am eternally grateful.

I am eternally grateful.

fresh out of Genesis,  writing like I’m Aeschylus
tragedy’s my specialty and Love is my nemesis 
Pardon if I reminisce, remembering her exodus 
breath slipping I was swift swimming to her sinking ship 

should’ve taken Pegasus, peg me incredulous
legs limping up the last steps of Mount Olympus 
Memory of her lips was shaded in her eclipse 
melody of her curves were captured in her ellipse 

I’m the mathematics of the maddest man 
Adding up my maladies, subtracting all my future plans 
Planning on having haphazard plots to be the saddest man 
Man I am so glad to have happened at all, happily I am 

I am so certain of my uncertainty 
open up my curtain and welcome to what burdens me 
burning deep hurting me
is a thousand degrees of separation from what I used to be 
woe is me, alone to see, alone is free 

tragedy’s my specialty and Love is my nemesis
I stay elegant, eloquent until Hell insists
I sell my soul so I can purge me of these curses
and maybe stay alive and find somebody’s purpose

I poured a glass until even the optimist agreed
the half given never feels like the half received
half of me believed happily that we would be
just a dot in the sky not a world of debris 

all I need is a dream 
staring at the sky asking god to believe
bless my soul, bless my heart, bless the blood that I bleed
bless the little hands that hold me when the demons are released

needing everything that couldn’t be for free
free my soul from years of listening to me 
I found a throne in the ozone just to feel the breeze 
when the birds and the bees came bruised at the knees 

truth kissed in degrees 
soft hips told me everything I need 
I was lost in the cracks of a memory 
I am lost, I am free 

tragedy’s my specialty and Love is my nemesis
I stay elegant, eloquent until Hell insists
I sell my soul so I can purge me of these curses
and maybe stay alive and find somebody’s purpose

I find solace when speaking these words cease in me
my mind’s at rest and at last I can rest peacefully
this people pleasing is masking all of my misery
I seek the silence through the violence, praying for a decent sleep

Find me on a raft in the middle of Lake Michigan
calling out for help using riddles and fake signals and
wait for the bigger ship and they say “Oh, not him again”
Sorry for the trouble, I was here last weekend

Please send for the spaces that I left, yesterdays
silhouettes throwing shade at what’s kept
a little 
love burned through the last cigarette 
in the dark after thoughts never glow to impress 
words rippled in the waves of her dress 
standing on the shore, I was blind and out of breath 
I guess, 
she never needed what I promised in the end 
we never needed to pretend 

tragedy’s my specialty and Love is my nemesis
I stay elegant, eloquent until Hell insists
I sell my soul so I can purge me of these curses
and maybe stay alive and find somebody’s purpose

(blue light bleeds life into violet
through the rings we arrive in silence
I took a hit, I was feeling kind of violent
violated by a ghost freckled in defiance)

I’m feeling like disappearing into the infinite and falling and falling and falling. That is the only thing that makes sense to me right now. In the void, I feel the most full. I suppose this is the end.

she never taught me how to grieve
(but she found peace in the earth and she taught me how to leave
at least that’s why her messages were meaningful to me
when her brain and her body were breaking at the seams)

she always taught me how to bleed
bearing burdens but they couldn't quite coagulate a creed
I wrapped her baggage in a bandage but the scars need to breathe
skies burn a little brighter when you're nestled in the weeds

she never learned how to wish for her future
her tumors were suitors that I hoped wouldn’t suit her
Pain is a looter forever lurking in my Sewers
I’m spewing this humor so I don’t have to lose her

this ain’t the way that they say it has to be, right?
just pray all day and maybe I can sleep nights?
this ain’t the way that they say it has to be, right?
just pray the day away and maybe I can sleep nights?

And falling and falling and falling

she found wandering, I conquered my needs,
I tried waking in her moments but did not succeed
please forgive me for the love I took, forgive me for my greed
please forgive me for the love I took, forgive me for my greed

forgive me or forbid me, I’ll outlive the hate within me
sincerely supersede my serious case of Empty
Attempting to empty my contempt for this life
and all my unkempt envy when I say my goodbyes

dear dear, I’ve been ruthless -
and all my attempts to say sorry have been foolish 
I don’t know how to do this, I’m toothless, losing all hope
of moving past the rude music of feeling useless

it’s these moments when I need you the most
I’m fading slow and befriending my ghost
God only knows where these spirits go
when I’m drifting in the dark off of Death’s closest coast

And falling and falling and falling

she found wandering, I conquered my needs,
I tried waking in her moments but did not succeed
please forgive me for the love I took, forgive me for my greed
please forgive me for the love I took, forgive me for my greed

I've forgotten what it means to believe
I ran away and found myself apologizing to the trees and
I leapt so I could fall with the leaves of the nevergreen
lemon lime dreams hiding sweet between the sheets

I was good at taking what I couldn't keep and
I was good until the pain became relief
only looking for peace or pieces of me 
she came and I was conquered by a love that wasn't free

I echoed in defeat, I echoed in decease
death ceased to be the monster underneath
just a tickle on my feet, just a figment of release
I came and you were gone, light floating into deep
light floating into deep
light floating into deep

And falling and falling and falling
tragedy’s my specialty 
and Love is my nemesis.

All of this self-loathing is burning up inside of me. And the only thing left after the fire dies down is her. The only constant in this void is her. I can’t escape her. I can’t escape the memories – even though some are fading into nothing. Why do I hold on to some moments? Why do others disappear? 

I forgot you never settled in your sleep
and I forgot the way your body found its creases in me
caught slipping in her curves and what it meant to be /free
dropping prayers to the dirt just so I could believe

but now I'm torn between the ifs and the who-I-ought-to-bes
do I please the god above or sate the demons in me?

see I’ve been living round the wayside
pistols and a glass (crystal) pride (died)
swimming in the cocktailed streams of a dream lie 

hearing voices in my skull, duller than my silence
loading choices with this pull, triggering my violence
trickle in my fickle sins and you have my mind’s islands
idle lives I idolize with her god as my guidance

I’m losing myself, self-boozing my health
wealth proving my Hell, tell truths and I’m well

this world gets so blurry, my sound and her fury,
furious fights and I know that she heard me

hurry up, my flurries on its way to her capital
I capsize my wired eyes to make love as an animal

when God created
love cremated
crashing ash into new spaces
two fresh faces
two blessed laces
tied around her lost embraces 
goodness gracious you are patient
I know, I know
I know, I know
foolish faces I am vacant
you know, you know
you know, I know

This is the remembering. This is the sorrow and the regret. 

riding to the city on the green
lining up pretties it’s obscene
sipping 50 proof, vodka with the juice, I guess you could call it my sunscreen

screaming on the train it’s a scene
feeling all this pain re-up and recede
liquor got me numb, friends acting dumb, and this weed came with a receipt

see me in the town square coughing on squares
I’m square, I’m aware that I’m new to this
I don’t care, I’m caught up in my foolishness
Please beware, I get lost when I’m losing this

these thoughts get so hot, God’s fueling them
I don’t believe, I forgot how I am spewing them
Just breathe, speak the past that’s oozing in
At ease, please your pain with the booze again

Boozer with the buzzer beater 
Beating Buzz Lightyears, buzzed off Bud light tears,
it’s a tough night here,
and a rough life there
and I’m off nightmares 
and I’m oh so scared
but I’m glad I’m here

‘cause I’m on the eve of everything,
even every rainy spring,
even maybe mourning rings
when morning came to heaven’s king

there i go with God again
gaining on my thoughts again
here for now but now and then
he fades away, one last amen

one, one, one, one last amen
one, one, one, one last amen

I've been praying that I make it through the year
just so I can feel the rain fall far away from here
to be clear my fears were crystallizing in the atmosphere 
but sorrow had a funny way of drowning in a couple beers

a hallelujah in the dark 
lit a spark 
but my bark was up the wrong tree
I believed even though I couldn't see
see I believe when the promises are free

at the bottom of the sea sipping Hennessy 
my enemies telling me the pain is a remedy 
torn in the seams of a dream and a memory
I was born with my scars held tenderly

I tend to be blind rewinding out of foolishness
time pools with the tide moon shine in the mind
I remind the skies that I'm new to this
hands tied but my loose eyes luminous 

(reckless in the soul 
freckled as a whole
blue and blue and blue and )

I want to go where the sun don't shine
where the stains are sweet 
where my name is mine
where the rhythm in the night lights the colors of the rhyme
hoping for a place to hide

I was asking for forgiveness but I guess you didn’t care
with the salt in your stare and the heaven in your air
feet planted in the dirt with a rose and a dare
not to feel the greed of gravity when love was unprepared

oh lord just let me breathe
(oh lord) oh lord just feed
the heart that lets this body bleed
one last amen is all I need

one
one 
one last amen

You are someone I will never be.

you are beautiful
you are beautiful
I am
I don't know
something usual
I am 
blues 
I am blue 
I am blue blooded pools
under water
under you

brace my mind brace my soul
empty hearts feeling full
lost in space found in time
you are yours I’m not mine

brace your mind brace your soul
half of self feeling whole
found at last lost again
wish of you now and then

posing my quips as an impotent imp
limping on figurative legs, losing shit
head floating lonely, my infinite blimp
it won’t be a good year, but thanks for the tip

thanks for the key you left under my mat
I spent the whole summer trying to give it right back
I hope I wasn’t rude, I hope I wasn’t cruel
but it felt just right to take different paths

you are beautiful
you are beautiful
I am
I don't know
something usual
I am 
blues 
I am blue 
I am blue blooded pools
under water
under you

God hear me now.

God only knows the trouble I’ve caused
God only knows the friends I’ve lost
God only knows what I only know
And that’s the pain of being crossed

Crossed up and crossed out
Criss-crossed on Christ’s cross
Tossed up and tossed out
Lip-locked with earth’s boss

i’m unsettled, rose unpetalled, 
disentangle my mental medals,
first place - nothing
last place - something
someone please help, i’m too sentimental

i’ve made enough room for my own little devil
he’s not leaving soon, I’m feeling too special
let me revel, at this level,
building the devil ten godly temples

Amending and repenting all my sins that I’m spending
sending thoughts and prayers to the hopes that I’m ending
And in life, this advice that I’m lending
wish for more, cry for less, life is always pending

perhaps i misspoke about a second ago
perhaps i missed love by begging for more
perhaps you knew i was a lesson in “no”
perhaps you flew bye in blessings, i know

i know i know i can’t please everybody
i know i know i’m just too melancholy

color me in whatever shade of blue you like
color me in whatever shade of you you like 

i’m blurring all my visions of you ‘cause i know i lost
i’m burning all these pictures of me ‘cause i know i’m wrong
who could’ve guessed that feeling better would take this long
i’m weak i know but maybe one day i could be as strong 

as the way that you always were
i was stuck repeating moments, i never heard
your pleas for more, your pleas for more
your pleas for me to change my ways

every single day, i was stuck in myself
i was blind to her rays

i was blind to self-destruction
thought I wasn’t something
knew I couldn’t muster up the strength to be more than nothing

i’m more than god could ever think of
but not in the way she would ever ever dream of

my thoughts reach high as a mountain peak does
that mountain crumbles with a soft touch
a soft look
is all is takes to break me down

into past me’s
tossed around
buried deep
under ground
under her
is what’s left of me
under me
is what’s left of she
she never knew
I was you
but I knew this for an eternity
I know

i know i know i can’t please everybody
i know i know i’m just too melancholy

color me in whatever shade of blue you like
color me in whatever shade of you you like 

my is nose bleeding once again but I should know me,
i think that is my weary heart escaping from me
just needs to breathe the cool air like she’s breaking from me
it’s torn in three and my rosary can’t find comfort in me

my skin is peeling 
i’m kneeling on shattered knee caps
my tongue is reeling
i’m feeling like let me relapse

perhaps my spine will spit 
and i will spite my collapse
or maybe once my nerves will numb, i will finally relax

the sky flashes, my eyes spark
i’m my shadow in the dark
i’m my shadow in the dark
my mind crashes, my hearts stops
i might fall when God drops
i might fall when God drops

i might miss planet earth and drift forever on
i dread the day when she won’t miss me when i’m gone
i dread the dusk that isn’t followed by a dawn
i know i dread too much, i know i lost this marathon

i know i know i can’t please everybody
i know i know i’m just too melancholy

color me in whatever shade of blue you like
color me in whatever shade of you you like 

i know i know i can’t please everybody
i know i know i’m just too melancholy

lazing on the beach dreaming of sun sets
setting up dreams of things I haven’t done yet
probably never will, I don’t have the will
but I do know how to burn through this cigarette

I do know how to yearn for what i don’t deserve
I do know how to learn i am not why i hurt

i’m squirming, palms serving up sermons
legs praising God’s earnings
toes curling in cursive
arms raising up workings

of a better man
smarter man kinder man
he’s surely better than me

I’m weak in the knees
soft in the spine
lofty dreams of a hero
i gotta rewind

life please slow down
i’m too old for this now
heart too cold for her smile
eyes too warped to see miles

ahead of me
that’s a better me
smarter me kinder me

I’m surely better than I was
I’m surely better than I was

I’ll say it over and over
but that doesn’t mean it’s true
I’ll say it over and over
but that doesn’t mean it’s true
doesn’t mean it’s true

here i am taking back roads through black woods
i’m living life backwards, lost in traffic
i found myself again lost in madness,
i had life established as more than tragic
i’m acting, i’m spazzing
i’m trapped in a rut not taking action

i’m actually something more than magic
more than magic

I’m surely better than i was
i’m surely better than i was

i’m surely better than i was
i’m surely better than i was


I’ll say it over and over
but that doesn’t mean it’s true
I’ll say it over and over
but that doesn’t mean it’s true
doesn’t mean it’s true

I am something usual. A pixel in a gray image on a flickering computer screen. A fleeting judgmental thought that is silenced. The yearning for an extra minute of sleep. And it all feels very numb. 

we are the centers of our universe
we can’t stop these winters and this truth it hurts
but we can split these splinters, spit verse after verse
pursing our lips locked, avoiding the hearse

I once overheard heroes wallowing out
about how they can’t live up to the sound
of followers falling into the ground
and leaving behind no love to be found

taking baby steps to death just like my therapist told me
faking maybe yesses, I stress that this life is holy, hold please
my phone’s a little busy, I’m dizzy, and the world is only
a little insecure, I’m sure, that we are so lonely, hold me

she looked in my eye, all she saw was a pale blue dot
I looked to the sky and said, “That’s a pretty nice thought”

I used to feel fear, I used to feel the world turn, I used to feel
but lately I’ve been wandering, wondering if all this is real
masticated mammaries, masturbated memories
wish I could remember more than that
seems a long time ago you told me you would never go
and I’ve been running from it, from the past
from the thousand ways to hate the way I said I loved you back
and your heart keeps beating through the cracks
and I write to find the dark embrace,
fill the glass until the fight goes away
hold the knife close, flow penetrates
and await
but I’m sitting on the rim just so I can feel the burn again
sipping on the holy water, Holy Ghost in the pen
got a kid lit sin feeling like a vitamin
spitting all alone thinking holiness is only them
only in the dark does a spark feel alive
flicker in your eye licks the rings in the sky
I fell asleep in the blanket of your mind
I fell asleep before you cried

I fell asleep
I fell asleep
I fell asleep until you and I knew that we had died
and this life was not the way that they say it’s supposed to be
I did not have the thought that love got ahold of me
maybe once, maybe twice when she would get close to see
all my faults were all my fault and that’s just speaking honestly

I can’t talk to you any truer than that
at the end of my line, the extent of my craft
I am floating away on this rickety raft
when I feel a soft touch on my blistering back

she was there (she was there)
with a stare (with a stare)
She told me, “row slowly, and breathe in my air”

she looked in my eye all she saw was a pale blue dot
I looked to the sky and said “that’s pretty nice thought”

Dusk settles along the slits of streams
the creases of your lips now dry as dust
my letters are for you.

lines of ink
like sandbars against the break
I’ve reduced myself

-with the rise 
and fall of rib cages-

to everything.

I’ve never understood the way oceans echo and rattle against misunderstandings.

I reiterate:

I have never understood the way oceans echo and shelter bodies against the sky.

I think I’m finished now.

God is assembled.


(A very long silence.)
– But you have friends.
(A long silence.)
You have a lot of friends.
What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?
(A long silence.)
 What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?
 (A long silence.)
 What do you offer?
 (Silence.)
a consolidated consciousness resides in a darkened banqueting hall
near the ceiling of a mind whose floor shifts as ten thousand
cockroaches when a shaft of light enters as all thoughts unite in an
instant of accord body no longer expellent as the cockroaches
comprise a truth which no one ever utters
I had a night in which everything was revealed to me.
How can I speak again?
the broken hermaphrodite who trusted hermself alone finds the room
in reality teeming and begs never to wake from the nightmare
and they were all there
every last one of them
and they knew my name
as I scuttled like a beetle along the backs of their chairs
Remember the light and believe the light
An instant of clarity before eternal night
don't let me forget
 4
I am sad
I feel that the future is hopeless and that things cannot improve
I am bored and dissatisfied with everything
I am a complete failure as a person
I am guilty, I am being punished
I would like to kill myself
I used to be able to cry but now I am beyond tears
I have lost interest in other people
I can't make decisions
I can't eat
I can't sleep
I can't think
I cannot overcome my loneliness, my fear, my disgust
I am fat
I cannot write
I cannot love
My brother is dying, my lover is dying, I am killing them both
I am charging towards my death
I am terrified of medication
I cannot make love
I cannot fuck
I cannot be alone
I cannot be with others
My hips are too big
I dislike my genitals
At 4.48
when depression visits
I shall hang myself
to the sound of my lover's breathing
I do not want to die
I have become so depressed by the fact of my mortality that I have
decided to commit suicide
 5
I do not want to live
I am jealous of my sleeping lover and cover his induced
unconsciousness
When he wakes he will envy my sleepless night of thought and
speech unslurred by medication
I have resigned myself to death this year
Some will call this self-indulgence
(they are lucky not to know its truth)
Some will know the simple fact of pain
This is becoming my normality

It wasn't for long, I wasn't there long. But drinking bitter black coffee I
catch that medicinal smell in a cloud of ancient tobacco and something
touches me in that still place and a wound form two years ago opens
like a cadaver and a long buried shame roars its foul decaying grief.
A room of expressionless faces string blankly at my pain, so
devoid of meaning there must be evil intent.
Dr This and Dr That and Dr Whatsit who's just passing and
thought he'd pop in to take the piss as well. Burning in a hot 
 6
tunnel of dismay, my humiliation complete as I shake without
reason and stumble over words and have nothing to say about
my 'illness' which anyway amounts only to knowing that there's
no point in anything because I'm going to die. And I am
deadlocked by that smooth psychiatric voice of reason which
tells me there is an objective reality in which my body and mind
are one. But I am not here and never have been. Dr This writes it
down and Dr That attempts a sympathetic murmur. Watching
me, judging me, smelling the crippling failure oozing from my
skin, my desperation clawing and all-consuming panic
drenching me as I gape in horror at the world and wonder why
everyone is smiling and looking at me with secret knowledge of
my aching shame.
Shame shame shame.
Drown in your fucking shame.
Inscrutable doctors, sensible doctors, way-out doctors, doctors
you'd think were fucking patients if you weren't shown proof
otherwise, ask the same questions, put words in my mouth, offer
chemical cures for congenital anguish and cover each other's
arses until I want to scream for you, the only doctor who ever
touched me voluntarily, who looked me in the eye, who laughed
at my gallows humour spoken in the voice from the newly-dug
grave, who took the piss when I shaved my head, who lied and
said it was nice to see me. Who lied. And said it was nice to see
me. I trusted you, I loved you, and it's not losing you that hurts
me, but your bare-faced fucking falsehoods that masquerade as
medical notes.
Your truth, your lies, not mine.
And while I was believing that you were different and that you
maybe even felt the distress that sometimes flickered across
your face and threatened to erupt, you were covering your arse
too. Like every othoer stupid mortal cunt.
To my mind that's betrayal. And my mind is the subject of these
bewildered fragments.
Nothing can extinguish my anger.
And nothing can restore my faith.
This is not a world in which I wish to live.

–Have you made any plans?
–Take an overdose, slash my wrists then hang myself.
–All those things together?
–It couldn't possibly be misconstrued as a cry for help.
(Silence.)
–It wouldn't work.
–Of course it would.
–It wouldn't work. You'd start to feel sleepy from the overdose
and wouldn't have the energy to cut your wrists.
(Silence.)
–I'd be standing on a chair with a noose around my neck.
(Silence.)
– If you were alone do you think you might harm yourself?
–I'm scared I might.
–Could that be protective?
–Yes. It's fear that keeps me away from the train tracks. I just
hope to God that death is the fucking end. I feel like I'm eighty
years old. I'm tired of life and my mind wants to die.
–That's a metaphor, not reality.
–It's a simile.
–That's not reality.
–It's not a metaphor, it's a simile, but even if it were, the defining
feature of a metaphor is that it's real.
(A long silence.)
–You are not eighty years old.
(Silence.)
Are you?
 8
(A silence.)
Are you?
(A silence.)
Or are you?
(A long silence.)
–Do you despise all unhappy people or is it me specifically?
–I don't despise you. It's not your fault. You're ill.
–I don't think so.
–No?
–No. I'm depressed. Depression is anger. It's what you did, who
was there and who you're blaming.
–And who are you blaming?
–Myself.
Body and soul can never be married
I need to become who I already am and will bellow forever at this
incongruity which has committed me to hell
Insoluble hoping cannot uphold me
I will drown in dysphoria
in the cold black pond of my self
the pit of my immaterial mind
How can I return to form
now my formal thought has gone?
Not a life that I could countenance.
They will love me for that which destroys me
the sword in my dreams
the dust of my thoughts
the sickness that breeds in the folds of my mind
 9
Every compliment takes a piece of my soul
An expressionist nag
Stalling between two fools
They know nothing –
 I have always walked free
Last in a long line of literary kleptomaniacs
(a time honoured tradition)
Theft is the holy act
On a twisted path to expression
A glut of exclamation marks spells impending nervous breakdown
Just a word on a page and there is the drama
I write for the dead
the unborn
After 4.48 I shall not speak again
I have reached the end of his dreary and repugnant tale of a sense interned
in an alien carcass and lumpen by the malignant spirit of the moral
majority
I have been dead for a long time
Back to my roots
I sing without hope on the boundary
RSVP ASAP
Sometimes I turn around and catch the smell of you and I cannot go on
I cannot fucking go on without expressing this terrible so fucking awful
physical aching fucking longing I have for you. And I cannot believe
that I can feel this for you and you feel nothing. Do you feel nothing?
(Silence.)
 10
And I go out at six in the morning and start my search for you. If I've
dreamt a message of a street or a pub or a station I go there. And I wait
for you.
(Silence.)
You know, I really feel like I'm being manipulated.
(Silence.)
I've never in my life had a problem giving another person what they
want. But no one's ever been able to do that for me. No one touches me,
no one gets near me. But now you've touched me somewhere so fucking
deep I can't believe and I can't be that for you. Because I can't find you.
(Silence.)
What does she look like?
And how will I know her when I see her?
She'll die, she'll die, she'll only fucking die.
(Silence.)
Do you think it's possible for a person to be born in the wrong body?
(Silence.)
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you for rejecting me by never being there,
fuck you for making me feel shit about myself, fuck you for bleeding
the fucking love and life out of me, fuck my father for fucking up my
life for good and fuck my mother for not leaving him, but most of all,
fuck you God for making me love a person who does not exist,
FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU.
–Oh dear, what's happened to your arm?
–I cut it.
–That's a very immature, attention seeking thing to do. Did it give
you relief?
–No.
–Did it relieve the tension?
 11
–No.
–Did it give you relief?
(Silence.)
Did it give you relief?
–No.
–I don't understand why you did that.
–Than ask.
–Did it relieve the tension?
(A long silence.)
Can I look?
–No.
–I'd like to look, to see if it's infected.
–No.
(Silence.)
–I thought you might do this. Lots of people do. It relieves the
tension.
–Have you ever done it?
–...
–No. Far too fucking sane and sensible. I don't know where you
read that, but it does not relieve the tension.
(Silence.)
Why don't you ask me why?
Why did I cut my arm?
–Would you like to tell me?
–Yes.
- Then tell me.
 12
–ASK.
ME.
WHY.
(A long silence.)
–Why did you cut your arm?
–Because it feels fucking great. Because it feels fucking amazing.
– Can I look?
–You can look. But don't touch.
–(Looks) And you don't think you're ill?
– No.
–I do. It's not your fault. But you have to take responsibility for
your own actions. Please don't do it again.
I dread the loss of her I've never touched
love keeps me a slave in a cage of tears
I gnaw my tongue with which to her I can never speak
I miss a woman who was never born
I kiss a woman across the years that say we shall never meet
 Everything passes
 Everything perishes
 Everything palls
my thought walks away with a killing smile
leaving discordant anxiety
which roars in my soul
No hope No hope No hope No hope No hope No hope No hope
A song for my loved one, touching her absence
the flux of her heart, the splash of her smile
In ten years time she'll still be dead. When I'm living with it, dealing
with it, when a few days pass when I don't even think of it, she'll still
be dead. When I'm an old lady living ion the street forgetting my 
 13
name she'll still be dead, she'll still be dead, she'll still be dead, it's
just
fucking
over
and I must stand alone
My love, my love, why have you forsaken me?
She is the couching place where I never shall lie
and there's no meaning to life in the light of my loss
Built to be lonely
to love the absent
Find me
Free me
from this
corrosive doubt
futile despair
horror in repose
I can fill my space
fill my time
but nothing can fill this void in my heart
The vital need for which I would die
Breakdown
–No ifs or buts.
–I didn't say if or but, I said no.
–Can't must never have-to always won't should shan't.
The unnegotiables
Not today.
(Silence.)
 14
–Please. Don't switch off my mind by attempting to straighten me
out. Listen and understand, and when you feel contempt don't
express it, at least not verbally, at least not to me.
(Silence.)
–I don't feel contempt.
–No?
–No. It's not your fault.
–It's not your fault, that's all I ever hear, it's not your fault, it's an
illness, it's not your fault, I know it's not my fault. You've told
me that so often I'm beginning to think it is my fault.
–It's not your fault.
–I KNOW.
–But you allow it.
(Silence.)
Don't you?
–There's not a drug on earth can make life meaningful.
–You allow this state of desperate absurdity.
(Silence.)
You allow it.
(Silence.)
–I won't be able to think. I won't be able to work.
–Nothing will interfere with your work like suicide.
(Silence.)
–I dreamt I went to the doctor's and she gave me eight minutes to
live. I'd been sitting in the fucking waiting room half an hour.
(A long silence.)
Okay, let's do it, let's do the drugs, let's do the chemical
lobotomy, let's shut down the higher functions of my brain and
perhaps I'll be a bit more fucking capable of living.

Hatch opens
Stark light
the television talks
full of eyes
the spirits of sight
and now I am so afraid
 18
I'm seeing things
I'm hearing things
I don't know who I am
tongue out
thought stalled
the piecemeal crumple of my mind
Where do I start?
Where do I stop?
How do I start?
(As I mean to go on)
How do I stop?
How do I stop?
How do I stop?
How do I stop?
How do I stop? A tab of pain
How do I stop? Stabbing my lungs
How do I stop? A tab of death
How do I stop? Squeezing my heart
I'll die
not yet
but it's here
Please...
Money...
Wife...
Every act is a symbol
the weight of which crushes me
A dotted line on the throat
CUT HERE
DON'T LET THIS KILL ME
THIS WILL KILL ME AND CRUSH ME AND
SEND ME TO HELL
I beg you to save me from this madness that eats me
a sub-intentional death
 19
I thought I should never speak again
but now I know there is something blacker than desire
perhaps it will save me
perhaps it will kill me
a dismal whistle that is the cry of heartbreak around the hellish
bowl at the ceiling of my mind
a blanket of roaches
cease this war
My legs are empty
Nothing to say
And there is the rhythm of madness
–It's all right.
–LOOK AWAY FROM ME
–It's all right. I'm here.
–Look away from me
Why am I stricken?
I saw visions of God
and it shall come to pass
 20
Grid yourselves:
for ye shall be broken in pieces
it shall come to pass
Behold the light of despair
the glare of anguish
and ye shall be driven to darkness
If there is blasting
(there shall be blasting)
the names of offenders shall be shouted form the rooftops
Fear God
and his wicked convocation
a scall on my skin, a seethe in my heart
a blanket of roaches on which we dance
this infernal state of siege
All this shall come to pass
all the words of my noisome breath
Remember the light and believe the light
Christ is dead
and the monks are in ecstasy
We are the abjects
who depose our leaders
and burn incense unto Baal
Come now, let us reason together
Sanity is found in the mountain of the Lord's house on the
horizon of the soul that eternally recedes
The head is sick, the heart's caul torn
Thread the ground on which wisdom walks
Embrace beautiful lies –
the chronic insanity of the sane
the wrenching begins
–At 4.48
when sanity visits
for one hour and twelve minutes I am in my right mind.
When it has passed I shall be gone again,
 21
a fragmented puppet, a grotesque fool.
Now I am here I can see myself
but when I am charmed by vile delusions of happiness,
the foul magic of this engine of sorcery,
I cannot touch my essential self.
Why do you believe me then and now?
 Remember the light and believe the light.
Nothing matters more.
Stop judging by appearances and make a right judgement.
–It's all right. You will get better.
–Your disbelief cures nothing.
Look away from me.

In accident time where there are no accidents

cut off my limbs
but leave me my love
I would rather have lost my legs

pulled out my teeth
gouged out my eyes
than lost my love

Sanity is found at the centre of convulsion, where madness is scorched
form the bisected soul.
I know myself.
I see myself.
My life is caught in a web of reason
spun by a doctor to argument the sane.
At 4.48
I shall sleep
 24
I came to you hoping to be healed.
You are my doctor, my saviour, my omnipotent judge, my priest, my
god, the surgeon of my soul.
And I am your proselyte to sanity.

–You've seen the worst of me.
–Yes.
–I know nothing of you.
 26
–No.
–But I like you.
–I like you
(Silence.)
–You're my last hope.
(A long silence.)
–You don't need a friend you need a doctor.
(A long silence.)
–You are so wrong.
(A very long silence.)
–But you have friends.
(A long silence.)
You have a lot of friends.
What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?
(A long silence.)
What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?
(A long silence.)
What do you offer?
(Silence.)
We have a professional relationship. I think we have a good
relationship. But it's professional.
(Silence.)
I feel your pain but I cannot hold your life in my hands.
(Silence.)
You'll be all right. You're strong. I know you'll be okay because I
like you and you can't like someone who doesn't like themself.
The people I fear for are the ones I don't like because they hate 
 27
themselves so much they won't let anyone else like them either.
But I do like you. I'll miss you. And I know you'll be ok.
(Silence.)
Most of my clients want to kill me. When I walk out of here at the
end of the day I need to go home to my lover and relax. I need to
be with my friends and relax. I need my friends to be really

I fucking hate this job and I need my friends to be sane.

I'm sorry.
–It's not my fault.
–I'm sorry, that was a mistake.
–It's not my fault.
–No. It's not your fault. I'm sorry.
(Silence.)
I was trying to explain –
–I know. I'm angry because I understand, not because I don't.
Fattened up
 Shored up
 Shoved up
my body decompensates
my body flies apart
no way to reach out
beyond the reaching out I've already done
you will always have a piece of me
because you held my life in your hands
those brutal hands
 28
this will end me
I thought it was silent
till it went silent
how have you inspired this pain?
I've never understood
what it is I'm not supposed to feel
like a bird on the wing in a swollen sky
my mind is torn by lightning
as it flies form the thunder behind
Hatch opens
Stark light
and Nothing
Nothing
see Nothing
What am I like?
the child of negation
out of one torture chamber into another
a vile succession of errors without remission
every step of the way I've fallen
Despair propels me to suicide
Anguish for which doctors can find no cure
Nor care to understand
I hope you never understand
Because I like you
I like you
I like you
still black water
as deep as forever
as cold as the sky
as still as my heart when your voice is gone
I shall freeze in hell
of course I love you
you saved my life
I wish you hadn't
I wish you hadn't
I wish you'd left me alone
 29
a black and white film of yes or no yes or no yes or no yes or no yes or no yes
or no
I've always loved you
even when I hated you
What am I like?
just like my father
oh no oh no oh no
Hatch opens
Stark light
the rupture begins
I don't know where to look anymore
Tired of crowd searching
 Telepathy
and hope
Watch the stars
predict the past
and change the world with a silver eclipse
the only thing that's permanent is destruction
we're all going to disappear
trying to leave a mark more permanent that myself
I've not killed myself before so don't look for precedents
What came before was just the beginning
a cyclical fear
that's not the moon it's the earth
A revolution
Dear God, dear God, what shall I do?
 30
All I know
is snow
 and black despair
Nowhere left to turn
an ineffectual mortal spasm
the only alternative to murder
Please don't cut me up to find out how I died
I'll tell you how I died
One hundred Lofepramine, forty five Zopiclone, twenty five
Temazepam, and twenty Melleril
Everything I had
Swallowed
Slit
Hung
It is done
behold the Eunuch
of castrated thought
skull
unwound
the capture
 the rapture
 the rupture
 of a soul
a solo symphony
warm darkness
which soaks my eyes
I know no sin
 31
this is the sickness of becoming great
 the vital need for which I would die
 to be loved
I'm dying for one who doesn't care
I'm dying for one who doesn't know
 you're breaking me
Speak
Speak
Speak
ten yard ring of failure
look away from me
My final stand
No one speaks
Validate me
Witness me
See me
Love me
my final submission
my final defeat
the chicken's still dancing
the chicken won't stop
I think that you think of me
the way I'd have you think of me
 32
the final period
the final full stop
look after your mum now
look after your mum
 33
Black snow falls
in death you hold me
 never free
I have no desire for death
no suicide ever had
watch me vanish
watch me
vanish
watch me
watch me
watch
It is myself I have never met, whose face is pasted on the underside of my mind
please open the curtains
