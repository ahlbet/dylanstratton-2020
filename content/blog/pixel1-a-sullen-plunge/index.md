Welcome to a new thing I'm trying. I was in need of adding some more structure to my art making process slash just any organization around what I was making. This is an attempt at that.

It's also an attempt at a kind of sorta daily meditation space?? I've been doing meditations to some of the tunes and I've found it to be helpful. Some active listening, focusing in on specific sounds and stick with them for a bit. Nothing too involved, no pressure.

The plan is that each Pixel has a "song", a "painting" and a "poem". The song could really just be any gathering of synth sounds I'm enjoying. The painting could be any kind of digital, generative artwork -- something visual. The poem will most likely just be a collection of funny and pseudo-philosophical phrases the computer decides to generate that day.

I hope you find some calm.

_a sullen plunge_

```
keep the blue room
i have a reference for
my own self

ebb, as the sun

i heard a world wasted
and wasted away
and the loudest temples
rang at my feet

this is
a swollen sky
a sullen plunge
gleaming ripe with prayer
```
