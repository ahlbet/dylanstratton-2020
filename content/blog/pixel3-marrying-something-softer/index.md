things slowed down here a bit. as the fantastic hainbach says, "half speed is the best speed". i love the way the sounds open up when they're stretched out like this.

_marrying something softer_

```
man is subject to
worshipping
his worthlessness

he stands at the bridge of the
valley of terrors

wishing it all
to rest

his hand waked suddenly
and faded far
```
