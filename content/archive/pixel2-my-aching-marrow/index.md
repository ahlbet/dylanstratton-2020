i sat down to make a sleepy ambient tune. i ended up with this. that is one of the best parts about synthesis.

_my aching marrow_

```
you're the weakness
we knelt in the sun
nothing tempted me to touch

upon the sound
i think late into the night
i was boiling and
we were life
unimaginative and uneasy

i took up place within the big clouds
i am now
fast sinking
```
